Use Paper 1 as the foundation for Paper 2. Use my feedback to revise Paper 1. You may decide to modify the focus of your paper, though I discourage you from changing the topic entirely without consulting me. Although your paper should focus on two artworks, you can incorporate other artworks to strengthen your analysis and bolster your overarching argument. Consider a theme that connects the artworks (e.g. the cult of relics if you are writing about reliquaries). Your paper must have a thesis statement. Consider the following questions to formulate a research question that will help you develop a thesis statement.
* When, where, and why was the work made? By whom, and for whom?
* What did the work originally look like?
* Where would the work originally have been seen?
* What does the form (material, size, color, composition) contribute?
* What is the title? Does the title help to illuminate the work?
* What is the subject matter?
* For what purpose was this object made?
* What was the original context (artistic/historical/political/social/economic/philosophical/literary/functional etc.) of the work?
* What beliefs, values, or principles does the work express?

## Bibliography

The bibliography must include at least 10 sources. Tertiary sources (textbook, encyclopedias, etc.) and internet websites do not count, but you must cite them if you use them. Articles accessed through online research databases such as JSTOR do count. Be sure to evaluate your sources carefully. Note that internet websites often contain factual errors and lack critical depth. At least two sources have to be primary source documents. At least two secondary sources have to be printed books located in the stacks of the Boatwright Memorial Library.

## Research Question/Thesis Statement

2-3 sentences

Research questions help writers focus their research by providing a path through the research and writing process. The specificity of a well-developed research question helps writers avoid the “all-about” paper and work toward supporting a specific, arguable thesis. A research question is the question around which you center your research. It should be:
* clear: it provides enough specifics that one’s audience can easily understand its purpose without needing additional explanation.
* focused: it is narrow enough that it can be answered thoroughly in the space the writing task allows.
* concise: it is expressed in the fewest possible words.
* complex: it is not answerable with a simple “yes” or “no,” but rather requires synthesis and analysis of ideas and sources prior to composition of an answer.
* arguable: its potential answers are open to debate rather than accepted facts.

## Outline
The outline has to include the following elements:
* thesis statement (clear, focused, concise, complex, arguable)
* topic sentences for each paragraph

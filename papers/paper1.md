## In the Museum
To complete this paper, you must visit the [Virginia Museum of Fine Arts](https://www.vmfa.museum/) (VMFA). Note that we will visit VMFA together on September 13, and you may use that visit as an opportunity to begin your work on this paper. Browse the Galleries of Ancient and Medieval Art. Select an artwork that piques your interest. The artwork has to comply with the geographic and temporal parameters of this course. Make a detailed annotated drawing of the selected artwork and take a selfie with it, but be careful not to back into the artwork. Examine the artwork and write down your detailed observations. Record the information presented in the museum label, including the artwork's accession number.

Record your first impression(s) of the artwork. What stands out? Is there a focal point (an area to which the artist wants your eye to be drawn)? If so, what formal elements led you to this conclusion? Your impressions can help you reach your thesis.

## At Home
Write a visual analysis of the selected artwork's formal elements. A formal analysis includes an analysis of the forms appearing in the work you have chosen. These forms give the work its expression, message, or meaning. To aid in writing a formal analysis, you should think as if you were describing the work of art to someone who has never seen it before. When your reader finishes reading your analysis, she should have a complete mental picture of what the work looks like. Certain basic terms, which are listed below, are indispensable for describing artworks and buildings of any time and place. They make up the essential vocabulary of formal analysis, that is the visual analysis of artistic form. Keep in mind that you always need to back up your statements.
* form
* composition

How are the parts of the work arranged? Is there a stable or unstable composition? Is it dynamic? Full of movement? Or is it static?
* material and technique
* line

Are the outlines (whether perceived or actual) smooth, fuzzy, clear? Are the main lines vertical, horizontal, diagonal, or curved, or a combination of any of these? Are the lines jagged and full of energy? Sketchy? Geometric? Curvilinear? Bold? Subtle?
* color

What type of colors are used in the work? Bright? Dull? Complimentary? Does the artist use colors to draw your attention to specific areas of the work? How? If a sculpture, examine the color(s) of the medium and how it affects the work.
* texture

If a sculpture, is the surface smooth and polished or rough? Are there several textures conveyed? Where and how? If a painting, is there any texture to the paint surface? Are the brushstrokes invisible? Brushy? Sketchy? Loose and flowing? Or tight and controlled?
* space

If the artist conveys space, what type of space is used? What is the relation of the main figure to the space around it? Are the main figures entirely within the space (if the artwork is a painting), or are parts of the bodies cut off by the edge of the artwork? Is the setting illusionistic, as if one could enter the space of the painting, or is it flat and two-dimensional, a space that one could not possibly enter?
* mass
* volume
* perspective and foreshortening
* proportion

Does the whole or even individual parts of the figure(s) or natural objects in the work look naturalistic? Why did you come to this conclusion?
* scale

How big is the artwork? Are the figures or objects in the work life-sized, larger or smaller than life? How does the size affect the work?
* pose

If the work has figures, are the proportions believable? Realistic? Describe the pose(s). Is the figure active, calm, graceful, stiff, tense, or relaxed? Does the figure convey a mood? If there are several figures, how do they relate to each other (do they interact? not?)?
* light and shadow

Are shadows visible? Where? Are there dark shadows, light shadows, or both? How do the shadows affect the work?

Please use descriptive language and adjectives to describe your work. Begin with a general description of the work, and then move on to the more specific elements.

Note that not all of the terms listed above are applicable to every artwork. For example, not every artwork uses foreshortening. Consult pp. 1-13 in the textbook for more information about formal elements and on how to analyze them.

Once you have spent some time analyzing your work, notice if your first impression of the work has changed, now that you have taken a closer look? How? If you came up with a thesis statement before doing this in-depth analysis, you may want to change it if your impression of the work has changed. Your thesis statement should reflect your view of the object.

The formal analysis is more than just a description of the work. It should also include a **thesis statement** that reflects your conclusions about the work.  The thesis statement may, in general, answer a question like these:  What do I think is the meaning of this work? What is the message that this work or artist sends to the viewer? What is this work all about? The thesis statement is an important element. It sets the tone for the entire paper, and sets it apart from being a merely descriptive paper.

In the first paragraph, called the introduction, include:
* the name of the artist (if known), title (which is underlined or italicized every time you use the title in your paper; if the title is long, you can abbreviate it after the first time you use the full title), date, and medium
* what you think is the subject
* a very brief description of the work
* thesis statement (usually the last line or so of your first paragraph)

From that point, the rest of the formal analysis should include not only a description of the piece, but especially those details of the work that have led you to come to your thesis. Yet, your paper should not be a random flow of ideas about the work (i.e. stream of consciousness writing). Rather, your paper should have a sense of order, moving purposefully through your description with regard to specific elements (ex: one paragraph may deal with composition, another with a description of the figures, another with the background, another about line, etc.). Finally, in your conclusion (the final paragraph) you should end your paper with a restatement of your thesis.

**No research is to be used in this paper.** In other words, you are strictly relying on your ability to visually ‘read’ a work of art and make interpretations about it based on your analysis of it. Remember too that your analysis should not be just a mechanical, physical description.

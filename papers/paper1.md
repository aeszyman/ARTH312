# Paper 1
5-page research paper

Write a comparison of two medieval artworks that I have not presented in class. In making a comparison, do not simply make a list of similarities or of differences; make a point.

To select artworks, begin by consulting the following resources:
1. Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (VMFA), Medieval Gallery (G220A)
2. Online Collections
* [The Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search#!?department=17&showOnly=highlights&offset=0&pageSize=0&perPage=20&sortBy=relevance&sortOrder=asc&searchField=All)
* [The Cloisters](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search#!?department=7&showOnly=highlights&perPage=20&offset=0&pageSize=0&sortOrder=asc&searchField=All)
* [The Cleveland Museum of Art](http://www.clevelandart.org/)
* [The Walters Art Museum](https://thewalters.org/)

Schedule at least one 30-minute meeting with me to discuss your project.

# Paper 1
5-page research paper

Write a comparison of two medieval artworks that I have not presented in class. In making a comparison, do not simply make a list of similarities or of differences; make a point.

To select artworks, begin by consulting the following resources:
1. Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (VMFA), Medieval Gallery (G220A)
2. Online Collections

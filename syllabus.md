## Class Discussion
Research demonstrates that when you participate in class discussion, it benefits you. Most of you will pursue careers that require you to work in teams. To be an effective team member, one must be able to engage in dialogue, learn from colleagues, and help deal with challenges as a group. It is OK to challenge and refute ideas or positions, but not acceptable to attack someone personally or engage in name-calling.

## Course Policies
The use of cell phones and recording devices is prohibited.

The use of laptops is discouraged. If you absolutely need to use a laptop, you may only do so to take notes or pull up files relevant to class.
